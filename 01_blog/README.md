# Write a Data Science Blog Post

This project is the first part of Udacity's Data Science Nanondegree program.

## Overview
Introduce the CRISP-DM process for data analysis process and outline steps to typical analytics projects and how to communicate findings.

This project analyzes the gender pay gap of coding related jobs by using data from Stack Overflow's annual developer survey.

## Instructions
Use 'Salary_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb' to run Python code that I used to analyze the data. The notebook also contiains notes and observations as I explored and analyzed the data.

## Results
- The median salary for women was 87% of the salary of men. 
- Women in Generation Z have a higher median salary than men. However, in the older age generations, the traditional gender pay gap exists.
- For most levels of education, men have a higher median salary than women.
