# RECOMMENDATION ENGINES

This project used user interaction data from IBM's article platform
to build simple recommendation systems. These can be used to 
recommend new articles to users either based on overall
popularity or based on similar user interactions.There are 
two types of recommendation systems in this repo:

1. Rank based recommendations
2. User User Collaborative based recommendations


Use `Recommendations_with_IBM.html` to see the results of the
development of these recommendation systems. It includes exploratory
data analysis and development of each system.  

Use `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` if you want to explore the code
instead of looking at an html file.
